**Abstract**

Where would the safest and the most dangerous country for a U.S. citizen to travel?: As people living in the U.S. and as potential travelers, our question is necessary while making decisions regarding traveling. By critically analyzing data of “US citizen death overseas”, we might be able to take down internal biases people have in each country. Considering the number of cases in each country is most significant, we will address our question by comparing the death rate of each country and additionally the causes of deaths.

Travel, Death, Safety, Foreign Country, US citizen


**1.0 Introduction**
​​
Due to our research topic we have developed the data set of “US citizen death oversea”. The main idea is to be able to determine the safest place to travel for the US citizen. The timeline of this data set is from October 2002 through June 2018. It also lists out the cause of the death and cities for each individual case. Doing the research from the data could summarize and filter out the city with the lowest death rate of US citizens overseas and we will be able to determine the safest city to travel. In determining how safe or unsafe certain cities are, we hope to reexamine certain biases we may have against countries.

**2.0 Design Situation**

_Framing_: The topic of concern is travel safety and our perception of safety itself. Determining what places are safe has already been done before however, top websites usually use a complex algorithm in which they compare things like covid performance, peace index and average wealth. Adding such abstract values together into a single number creates some bias. We hope our data fixes some of those biases as well as gives accurate information for travel safety.

_Direct Stakeholder_: The direct stakeholders are tourists, immigrants or people who are planning to travel overseas. The datasets list out the city and cause of death for each case, after analyzing it it would become a suggestion or consideration  for the stakeholder’s safety.

_Indirect stakeholders_: The indirect stakeholders will focus mainly on the tourism rate of each city. When choosing a place to travel people normally pick the one that assures their personal safety. Places with lower death rates will be more popular and willing to travel than places with higher death rates. This effect will also impact cities GDP by personal consumption or Government spending.

_Possible harms_: The possible harm would be the reputation of each city because people would be willing to know the safety rate for each city and make a tag for the danger’s one. It will impact the most on tourism and indirectly affect the economics for those cities.

_Benefits_: People can better reduce risks of death by either avoiding to choose countries with the highest death rates or choosing the countries with the lowest death rates.

_Human Value_: The human value that shows in this research is the consideration when people make decisions. Due to the topic we are defining the safest place to travel which provides people suggestions when they travel.

**3.0 Research questions**

Which overseas city has the lowest death rate for US citizens?
Which overseas  city has the highest death rate for US citizens?
What is the main cause of death for US citizens?
Which city is worth the risk of travel?
Which city has improved the most? Which one has gotten worse?


The motivation for these questions is to determine which cities will be the safest place to travel overseas and which one is not. Within our dataset, each case came with a reason and where did it happen. This research is important to us because being a resident that lives on US territory we are able to travel all around the world, but before we travel, determining a safe destination could save our life or avoid danger. Our research will also determine which cities have gotten progressively safer or more dangerous for US citizens which may be important to someone who is planning on moving to that country or staying there for an extended period of time.

**4.0 The Datas**

_Size and complexity_:

Our Data set has 13045 units with 3 columns. However, we are planning to create more by adding time of day, splitting country and city, creating more general columns for cause of death and other things.

_Who or what is represented in the data?_:

We are representing the dangers of travel for a US citizen through a mortality rate.

_What is an observation? What variables are included (and excluded)_?

The observation is the death of a US citizen outside of the country. The main variables included are time of death, cause of death, and place of death. The time of death is specified to the minute, the cause of death is a somewhat descriptive expression and the place of death is specified to the city and country.

_Who  collected  the  data?  When?  For  what  purpose?  How  was  the  data  collection  effort funded? Who is likely to benefit from the data or make money?_

The US government collected the data. They collect the data every time someone dies outside of the country and post it to travel.state.gov . The purpose for this data collection is to provide information to people who are going to travel abroad by giving them a detailed layout of what happens should they die when they are outside of the country.  The data collection is funded by the government itself and has been funded since 2002. The people most likely to benefit from this data are people who are going to travel abroad or people who are going to live abroad. They will have information about what happens if they die when out of the country. It is not apparent if anyone profits from this data however I would assume not.

_How was the data validated and held secure?  Is it credible and trustworthy?_

The data is validated and held secure through the US government. This data is very credible and trustworthy because the US government is legally responsible and required to give us this data.

_How did you obtain the data? Do you credit the source of the data?_

We obtained this data by looking for data sets online and found this one to be quite important, but also not formatted in a way in which a normal person would be able to obtain any reasonable information on it.


**5.0 Expected Implications**

The main expected implication is for normal people deciding where to travel to. People like you and me can accurately look at the risk involved with each country and determine if that risk is worth the potential benefit of visiting that country.  Not only that, people looking to immigrate to another country may look at this data to see which countries are objectively safest. Policy makers can also look at this data to see certain ways in which to make their country safer. A consistent cause of death or consistent deaths within a city may be a red flag to policy makers within that country. A possible implication with our research may be for us to reconsider what places are truly dangerous or not. There are lots of biases against specific countries in the world and our data may reveal them to be false or reinforce them further.

**6.0 Limitations**

The main limitation is that we are not able to determine the plan and what are they doing during the trip. For some reason the people might implement something with high risk danger during their lifetime. Not being able to determine their motivation would affect the accuracy of our research question because people were traveling for different reasons. The reasons that include high risk dangers would increase their chance of dying and make our data biased against certain cities. Another limitation is that we are only measuring death. This means other causes of hardship like injuries or theft are not included in this data and will decrease our accuracy in determining which places are safer.
